            Each year management consultants in the United States receive more than $2 billion for their services.1 Much
            of this money pays for impractical data and poorly implemented recommendations.2 To reduce this waste,
            clients need a better understanding of what consulting assignments can accomplish. They need to ask more
            from such advisers, who in turn must learn to satisfy expanded expectations.

            This article grows out of current research on effective consulting, including interviews with partners and
            officers of five well-known firms. It also stems from my experience supervising beginning consultants and
            from the many conversations and associations I’ve had with consultants and clients in the United States and
            abroad. These experiences lead me to propose a means of clarifying the purposes of management consulting.
            When clarity about purpose exists, both parties are more likely to handle the engagement process
            satisfactorily.

            A Hierarchy of Purposes
            Management consulting includes a broad range of activities, and the many firms and their members often
            define these practices quite differently. One way to categorize the activities is in terms of the
            professional’s area of expertise (such as competitive analysis, corporate strategy, operations management,
            or human resources). But in practice, as many differences exist within these categories as between them.

            Another approach is to view the process as a sequence of phases—entry, contracting, diagnosis, data
            collection, feedback, implementation, and so on. However, these phases are usually less discrete than most
            consultants admit.

            Perhaps a more useful way of analyzing the process is to consider its purposes; clarity about goals
            certainly influences an engagement’s success. Here are consulting’s eight fundamental objectives, arranged
            hierarchically (also see the Exhibit):


            Exhibit A hierarchy of consulting purposes

            1. Providing information to a client.

            2. Solving a client’s problems.

            3. Making a diagnosis, which may necessitate redefinition of the problem.
            4. Making recommendations based on the diagnosis.

            5. Assisting with implementation of recommended solutions.

            6. Building a consensus and commitment around corrective action.

            7. Facilitating client learning—that is, teaching clients how to resolve similar problems in the future.

            8. Permanently improving organizational effectiveness.

            The lower-numbered purposes are better understood and practiced and are also more requested by clients. Many
            consultants, however, aspire to a higher stage on the pyramid than most of their engagements achieve.

            Purposes 1 through 5 are generally considered legitimate functions, though some controversy surrounds
            purpose 5. Management consultants are less likely to address purposes 6 through 8 explicitly, and their
            clients are not as likely to request them. But leading firms and their clients are beginning to approach
            lower-numbered purposes in ways that involve the other goals as well. Goals 6 through 8 are best considered
            by-products of earlier purposes, not additional objectives that become relevant only when the other purposes
            have been achieved. They are essential to effective consulting even if not recognized as explicit goals when
            the engagement begins.

            Moving up the pyramid toward more ambitious purposes requires increasing sophistication and skill in the
            processes of consulting and in managing the consultant-client relationship. Sometimes a professional tries
            to shift the purpose of an engagement even though a shift is not called for; the firm may have lost track of
            the line between what’s best for the client and what’s best for the consultant’s business. But reputable
            consultants do not usually try to prolong engagements or enlarge their scope. Wherever on the pyramid the
            relationship starts, the outsider’s first job is to address the purpose the client requests. As the need
            arises, both parties may agree to move to other goals.
            1. Providing Information
            Perhaps the most common reason for seeking assistance is to obtain information. Compiling it may involve
            attitude surveys, cost studies, feasibility studies, market surveys, or analyses of the competitive
            structure of an industry or business. The company may want a consultant’s special expertise or the more
            accurate, up-to-date information the firm can provide. Or the company may be unable to spare the time and
            resources to develop the data internally.

            Often information is all a client wants. But the information a client needs sometimes differs from what the
            consultant is asked to furnish. One CEO requested a study of whether each vice president generated enough
            work to have his own secretary. The people he contacted rejected the project because, they said, he already
            knew the answer and an expensive study wouldn’t convince the vice presidents anyway.

            Later, the partner of the consulting firm said, “I frequently ask: What will you do with the information
            once you’ve got it? Many clients have never thought about that.” Often the client just needs to make better
            use of data already available. In any case, no outsider can supply useful findings unless he or she
            understands why the information is sought and how it will be used. Consultants should also determine what
            relevant information is already on hand.

            Seemingly impertinent questions from both sides should not be cause for offense—they can be highly
            productive. Moreover, professionals have a responsibility to explore the underlying needs of their clients.
            They must respond to requests for data in a way that allows them to decipher and address other needs as an
            accepted part of the engagement’s agenda.

            2. Solving Problems
            Managers often give consultants difficult problems to solve. For example, a client might wish to know
            whether to make or buy a component, acquire or divest a line of business, or change a marketing strategy. Or
            management may ask how to restructure the organization to be able to adapt more readily to change; which
            financial policies to adopt; or what the most practical solution is for a problem in compensation, morale,
            efficiency, internal communication, control, management succession, or whatever.

            Seeking solutions to problems of this sort is certainly a legitimate function. But the consultant also has a
            professional responsibility to ask whether the problem as posed is what most needs solving. Very often the
            client needs help most in defining the real issue; indeed, some authorities argue that executives who can
            accurately determine the roots of their troubles do not need management consultants at all. Thus the
            consultant’s first job is to explore the context of the problem. To do so, he or she might ask:

            Which solutions have been attempted in the past, with what results?
            What untried steps toward a solution does the client have in mind?
            Which related aspects of the client’s business are not going well?
            If the problem is “solved,” how will the solution be applied?
            What can be done to ensure that the solution wins wide acceptance?
            A management consultant should neither reject nor accept the client’s initial description too readily.
            Suppose the problem is presented as low morale and poor performance in the hourly work force. The consultant
            who buys this definition on faith might spend a lot of time studying symptoms without ever uncovering
            causes. On the other hand, a consultant who too quickly rejects this way of describing the problem will end
            a potentially useful consulting process before it begins.

            When possible, the wiser course is to structure a proposal that focuses on the client’s stated concern at
            one level while it explores related factors—sometimes sensitive subjects the client is well aware of but has
            difficulty discussing with an outsider. As the two parties work together, the problem may be redefined. The
            question may switch from, say, “Why do we have poor hourly attitudes and performance?” to “Why do we have a
            poor process-scheduling system and low levels of trust within the management team?”

            Thus, a useful consulting process involves working with the problem as defined by the client in such a way
            that more useful definitions emerge naturally as the engagement proceeds. Since most clients—like people in
            general—are ambivalent about their need for help with their most important problems, the consultant must
            skillfully respond to the client’s implicit needs. Client managers should understand a consultant’s need to
            explore a problem before setting out to solve it and should realize that the definition of the most
            important problem may well shift as the study proceeds. Even the most impatient client is likely to agree
            that neither a solution to the wrong problem nor a solution that won’t be implemented is helpful.

            3. Effective Diagnosis
            Much of management consultants’ value lies in their expertise as diagnosticians. Nevertheless, the process
            by which an accurate diagnosis is formed sometimes strains the consultant-client relationship, since
            managers are often fearful of uncovering difficult situations for which they might be blamed. Competent
            diagnosis requires more than an examination of the external environment, the technology and economics of the
            business, and the behavior of nonmanagerial members of the organization. The consultant must also ask why
            executives made certain choices that now appear to be mistakes or ignored certain factors that now seem
            important.
